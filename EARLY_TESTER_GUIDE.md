# Beta Collaborator Guide

**For:** 3-5 committed collaborators validating Dec 1 launch
**Launch window:** Dec 1, 2025 → Q1 2026
**Commitment:** 4-8 hours total (flexible, self-paced)
**Pressure:** LOW. You're helping us validate—not evaluating us.

---

## Welcome! 👋

You've been invited to be a **Beta collaborator** with AgentOps—validating a framework for applying DevOps + SRE principles to AI agent operations. This is special: you're in the first wave publicly supporting the framework.

**This is NOT:**
- A product beta with support SLAs
- An endorsement request (we're not asking you to promote it)
- A "proof of concept" for your company
- A commitment to anything
- Work you "have to" do

**This IS:**
- Helping validate that operational discipline works for agents
- A chance to help shape the framework's future
- Early access to proven patterns before v1.0
- A community of practitioners solving the same problems
- **Completely optional** - no judgment if you step back
- **Real input** - your experience directly shapes what happens next

---

## What You're Actually Validating

**The Proven Hypothesis:**
> "DevOps + SRE principles (proven for infrastructure over 20 years) solve operational challenges with AI agents. We've proven this internally. Now we're validating it generalizes."

**What we're NOT claiming:**
- This is "v1.0 ready" yet
- Every pattern works everywhere
- There's one right way
- You have to use all 12 factors

**What we ARE validating:**
- Can someone outside our context implement this?
- Which patterns are most valuable for you?
- What breaks down in your context?
- How do we refine factors based on real use?
- How do we reach v1.0 together?

## How to Participate (Pick Your Level)

**What you get:**

- 🚫 Consensus (people will disagree)
- 🚫 Fast iteration (this takes time)
- 🚫 Endorsement expectations (zero pressure)

---

## FAQ for Early Testers

### "What if I don't understand something?"
Completely normal. Mark it as "unclear" in your feedback. That means the framework needs clarification.

### "What if I disagree with something?"
Perfect! Disagreement is valuable. Share your perspective. You might see something we missed.

### "What if I run out of time or lose interest?"
Zero judgment. Opt out anytime. No explanation needed. Just let me know if you're stepping back.

### "Will this be used against me?"
No. Early feedback is protected. We're not evaluating you—we're learning together.

### "What if my organization wants to use this?"
Great! We'll discuss openly. But there's no sales pitch here. Use it if it helps, don't if it doesn't.

### "Can I share this with my team?"
Yes, once we launch publicly (late Nov). Before then, keep it private—we're still refining.

### "How will you use my feedback?"
- If public: Credited in changelog
- If private: Incorporated anonymously
- All feedback shapes v1.0

### "Do I need to commit to anything?"
Nope. This is pure exploration. You can participate at whatever level fits your time/interest.

## One Last Thing

This is Alpha. Things will change. Ideas will evolve. Some things won't work.

**Your role is to be honest, curious, and willing to say "nope, that doesn't work."**

That's how we get better.
