# Contributing to 12-Factor AgentOps

We're building this framework together. Just like Kubernetes is a community project, AgentOps is research and development driven by the community.

## Philosophy

- **This is research, not a product** - We're discovering patterns, not selling solutions
- **We're learning together** - Your experiences shape the framework
- **Community-driven evolution** - Best ideas win, regardless of origin
- **Open by default** - Everything is transparent, discoverable, and discussable

## How to Contribute

### 1. Use the Framework & Share Validation Data
The best contribution is using AgentOps in your domain and sharing what you learn.

**Quick validation:** Use our [Community Validation Template](./validation/templates/community-validation.md) (30-60 min)
- Track which factors you used
- Document what worked and what didn't
- Share quantitative results if available
- Submit via PR to `validation/community/` or open an issue

**Rigorous validation:** Use our [Quantitative Study Template](./validation/templates/quantitative-study.md) (4-8 hours)
- For researchers or teams tracking detailed metrics
- Statistical analysis and hypothesis testing
- Publishable evidence for academic or professional use

**Why this matters:** Community validation helps us discover which patterns work universally vs. need domain-specific adaptation.

### 2. Report Issues
Found a problem? Help us understand it.

- Describe what you tried to do
- Show what happened
- Tell us what you expected
- Include your environment details

### 3. Share Patterns
Discovered a useful pattern? That's exactly what we need.

- Document the pattern
- Show why it works
- Provide examples
- Help us generalize it

### 4. Improve Documentation
Clear docs help everyone.

- Fix typos and unclear explanations
- Add examples
- Create guides for your domain
- Help others understand patterns

### 5. Create New Profiles
Does your domain need a specialized workflow?

- Start with an existing profile as template
- Define your domain-specific phases
- Document success metrics
- Test with your team
