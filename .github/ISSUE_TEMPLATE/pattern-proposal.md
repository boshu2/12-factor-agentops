## Checklist

Before submitting, please ensure:

- [ ] Pattern addresses a real operational challenge (not theoretical)
- [ ] Pattern has been tested in production (not just designed)
- [ ] Quantified results provided (metrics, not just intuition)
- [ ] Theoretical grounding clear (which of the 12 Factors support this)
- [ ] Generalization potential assessed (other domains considered)
- [ ] Related to AI agent operations (not general software patterns)

**Note:** Patterns should be validated through production use before inclusion in the catalog. If this is a promising idea but not yet validated, please open a Discussion instead.
