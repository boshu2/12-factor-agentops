## Checklist

Before submitting, please ensure:

- [ ] Pattern addresses a real operational challenge (not theoretical)
- [ ] Pattern has been tested in production (not just designed)
- [ ] Quantified results provided (metrics, not just intuition)
- [ ] Theoretical grounding clear (which Pillars/Laws support this)
- [ ] Generalization potential assessed (other domains considered)
- [ ] Related to AI agent operations (not general software patterns)
