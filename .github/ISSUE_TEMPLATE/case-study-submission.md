## Results

### Quantitative Impact

**Metrics Tracked:** [What did you measure?]

| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| [e.g., Time to deliver] | [baseline] | [result] | [% or Nx] |
| [e.g., Error rate] | [baseline] | [result] | [% or Nx] |
| [e.g., Context switches] | [baseline] | [result] | [% or Nx] |
| [e.g., Throughput] | [baseline] | [result] | [% or Nx] |

**Statistical Significance:** [Sample size, duration, confidence level]

**Measurement Methodology:** [How did you collect data?]

---

## Generalization

**Domain-Specific Aspects:** [What's unique to your context?]

**Transferable Insights:** [What generalizes to other domains?]

**Confidence in Generalization:**
