# selected backend — it will be included in the research output document for traceability.

### S...

**Session:** 6eb28972-1a92-4161-929a-9b598ec6d2cc
**Date:** 2026-02-15

## Decisions
- selected backend — it will be included in the research output document for traceability.

### Step 3: Launch Explore Agent

**YOU MUST DISPATCH AN EXPLORATION AGENT NOW.** Select the backend using...
- selected "Revise" - wanted deeper research

5. **User Feedback on Research Revision**: User explained they want a GROUND-UP REBUILD, not patching:
   - "the specs folder went into a lot of planning,...
- Decision: PROCEED with WARN
     - Wrote phase-3-summary.md
   - Phase 4 (Crank):
     - Invoked /crank skill with ol-718

- til all issues assigned

1. Does the blocked issue modify a file that the blocker also modifies? → **Keep**
2. Does the...
- Fixed by noting the correction in the research document.
   - **Premature beads creation**: Created beads epic ol-717 with 10 child issues for spec writing. User corrected: "the plan isn't just the...
- til all this"
   - "the plan isn't just the epic. The planning is all of these documents"
   - User wants: write all specs FIRST as planning docs, THEN create beads for code

9. **Plan Revision**: 
 ...
- till referencing v3 concepts — mt-olympus migration markers, council degraded-mode contracts, cluster boundaries, checkpoint fidelity, phase-machine coverage for v3 packages, etc. Most of these...
- til the epic is DONE.

**CLI dependencies:** bd (issue tracking), ao (knowledge flywheel). Both optional — see `skills/shared/SKILL.md` for fallback table. If bd is unavailable, use TaskList for...
- till blocked on ol-718.2.
- till blocked on it.
