# selected backend — it will be included in the research output document for traceability.

### S...

**Session:** 49f8df72-b639-418b-9e30-728740f5c7c2
**Date:** 2026-02-15

## Decisions
- selected backend — it will be included in the research output document for traceability.

### Step 3: Launch Explore Agent

**YOU MUST DISPATCH AN EXPLORATION AGENT NOW.** Select the backend using...
- architecture decisions, migration plans
- Reviews where multiple valid perspectives exist
- Cases where a missed finding has real consequences

Skip `--debate` for routine validation where consensus...
- the plan is sound. Without it, Phase 0 might build "worse Gas Town" instead of "better foundation for context control plane."

---

**Output written to:**...
- selected "Approve" to proceed to planning
   - User rejected `ao search` tool call during /plan execution
   - "/rpi" - User interrupted /plan to invoke the full RPI lifecycle skill instead
   - (No...

## Knowledge
- till functional but slower |


ARGUMENTS: Audit all 21 normative specs in docs/specs/ against the new PRODUCT.md identity. Olympus pivoted from "context orchestration platform for engineering teams"...
- til all issues assigned

#### Validate Dependency Necessity

For EACH declared dependency, verify:
1. Does the blocked issue modify a file that the blocker also modifies? → **Keep**
2. Does the...
- Key Insight:** Conformance checks are incomplete for 6 out of 8 issues. Messaging rewrites verify new content exists but not that semantics were preserved. Critical safety properties (stoppable...
- Key Insight
The plan learned from the council's FAIL. Scope is deliberately constrained to Phase 0 (mechanical daemon, no LLM), spec rewrites are messaging-only, and the plan explicitly forbids the...
- till running.
- Key Insight

Phase 0 daemon solves only **40% of the Operator's stated pain** — specifically the "across 17 repos" part (multi-repo tracking and automation). The core value proposition from...
- The fix is small: Add Gas Town comparison to daemon.md, revise kill criterion, reframe PRODUCT.md differentiation. These are spec clarifications, not architectural changes.

**Conditional pass...
- Key Insight:** Phase 0 daemon creates mechanical differentiation (multi-rig subprocess orchestration) but defers the unique value proposition (context control plane) to future phases. The plan...
- Key Insight:** The plan silently assumes daemon.md will specify 11 critical operational and integration contracts that determine whether Phase 0 is viable — but doesn't enumerate what those...
- Key Insight:** The plan addresses all 6 critical council findings with a mechanical Phase 0 daemon, but the single-user migration from Gas Town to Olympus has invisible friction: lost muscle memory,...
- til the epic is DONE.

**CLI dependencies:** bd (issue tracking), ao (knowledge flywheel). Both optional — see `skills/shared/SKILL.md` for fallback table. If bd is unavailable, use TaskList for...
- till need to run
   - Session close protocol not yet run (git status, bd sync, git commit, git push)

8. Current Work:
   Executing **Phase 4: /crank ol-715** of the RPI lifecycle. Specifically:
   -...
- Fixed by reading the file first, then writing.
   - **ao search rejected by user**: When running `ao search "plan validation lessons daemon spec rewrite"`, the user rejected the tool call. User then...
- till writing the spec file (larger task)

Waiting for ol-715.5 to finish.
- till waiting on ol-715.5 (daemon.md creation).
- till working — it listed the specs directory and is about to write the daemon.md file. This is the largest task (creating a full design spec). Waiting for completion.
- till passes
- Wave checkpoint for Wave 3
- Phase 5: /vibe (final validation)
- Phase 6: /post-mortem
- Session close protocol (git status, bd sync, git commit, git push)

Summary:
1. Primary Request...
- FIXED by lead)
     - 16 tests covering New(), poll loop cancellation, lock file, PID file, status, event log, subprocess, quest discovery
     - **CRITICAL FIX APPLIED**: Added `t.Setenv("HOME",...
- till vague.
- till needs?

**Is the path right?**

The Phase 0 mechanical daemon path is correct — it's the lowest-risk starting point and the council validated it. But the *competitive intelligence* is...
- till we change it again LOL) whats going into mount olympus. /rpi
