## Structural Review

### Factor Quality

All 12 factors have:
- Title heading
- "The Rule" section
- "The Rationale" section
- "What Good Looks Like" section
- 2,500-4,200 words (well above 500-word minimum)

### Content Highlights

| Factor | Words | Notable |
|--------|-------|---------|
| I. Context Is Everything | 3,012 | Observable symptoms, 40% rule, anti-patterns, lost-in-the-middle research |
| II. Track Everything in Git | 2,979 | Git as single source of truth, ADRs, session artifacts |
| III. One Agent, One Job | 2,780 | Fresh context per task, saturation detection, handoff protocol |
| IV. Research Before You Build | 3,037 | Distinct research phase, negative results, Without Tooling added |
| V. Validate Externally | 3,452 | No self-grading, validation hierarchy, multi-model councils |
| VI. Lock Progress Forward | 2,770 | Brownian Ratchet, chaos-is-cheap, protected branches |
| VII. Extract Learnings | 4,264 | Structured extraction, 5 artifact types, Without Tooling added |
| VIII. Compound Knowledge (HERO) | 2,641 | Flywheel pattern, compounding equation, retrieval/decay rates |
| IX. Measure What Matters | 2,800 | Fitness toward goals, dormancy-is-success, anti-vanity |
| X. Isolate Workers (Scale) | 2,651 | Worktrees, fresh context, isolation checklist |
| XI. Supervise Hierarchically (Scale) | 2,587 | Erlang supervision trees, bounded retries |
| XII. Harvest Failures (Scale) | 2,693 | Negative knowledge, failure libraries, Without Tooling added |

### README Quality

- 1,560 words (target: 800+)
- Inverted adoption model (quickstart → principles, not manifesto → tooling)
- 5-minute zero-infrastructure quickstart with concrete learnings.md example
- Four-tier factor table with "Without Tooling" per tier
- Persona-based value proposition (solo dev, tech lead, tool builder)
- Knowledge compounding as hero differentiator
- No stale framing references

### Archive Quality

- 14 files in `_archived/factors-v1/` (12 old factors + README + MAPPING.md)
- MAPPING.md has complete old→new factor mapping with disposition notes

## Council Verdict: PASS

**Confidence:** HIGH

**Key Insight:** The v3 pivot implementation is structurally complete and meets all 13 GOALS.yaml mechanically-verifiable criteria. Content quality is consistent across factors with appropriate differentiation (Foundation factors have Without Tooling sections, Scale factors are marked optional, Factor VIII is the hero with full flywheel content).

### Findings

| Severity | Category | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| minor | consistency | Factor 07 (Extract Learnings) is notably longer (4,264 words) than others (~2,700 avg). Could benefit from trimming. |
| minor | links | README references `docs/assets/` SVGs that were removed — badges still reference CI workflow that may need updating |
| minor | completeness | `docs/00-SUMMARY.md` needs a full rewrite to match v3 (only the header was updated) |

### Recommendation

Ship it. The core deliverable (12 rewritten factors + README + archive) is complete and passes all mechanically-verifiable criteria. The minor findings above are cleanup items, not blockers.

## Decision

[x] SHIP - All GOALS.yaml checks pass, content quality is consistent
[ ] FIX - Address concerns before shipping
[ ] REFACTOR - High complexity, needs rework
