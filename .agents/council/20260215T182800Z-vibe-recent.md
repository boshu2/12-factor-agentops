# Vibe Report: v3 Docs Rewrite (recent)

**Date:** 2026-02-15
**Mode:** quick (single-agent)
**Files Reviewed:** 41 content files (markdown + SVG)
**Epic:** 12-pr7 (v3 Documentation Full Rewrite)

## Complexity Analysis

**Status:** ⚠️ Skipped (no Python/Go code — all markdown/SVG documentation)

## Metadata Verification

| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| File existence | ✅ PASS — all 41 files in diff exist on disk |
| Stale framing | ✅ PASS — no "Shift-Left", "DevOps for Vibe", or "coding agents only" in modified files |
| Old factor names in modified files | ✅ PASS — remaining hits are in comparison tables / historical context (appropriate) |
| Cross-references (modified files) | ⚠️ WARN — 3 broken links to aspirational docs (team-workflows.md, platform-engineering.md) |

### Broken Links (3)

| Source | Broken Link | Severity |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| docs/getting-started/quick-start.md:265 | team-workflows.md | Low (aspirational "next steps") |
| docs/getting-started/quick-start.md:266 | platform-engineering.md | Low (aspirational "next steps") |
| docs/getting-started/solo-developer.md:594 | team-workflows.md | Low (aspirational "next steps") |

## Council Verdict: WARN

### Judge 1 (Content Quality)

**Verdict:** PASS

- factors/README.md: Clean 4-tier index with consistent formatting. All 12 factors present with v3 names.
- CONTRIBUTING.md: Thorough rewrite. DevOps mapping table correct. Four-tier structure explained. Contribution categories comprehensive.
- 00-SUMMARY.md: Proper ~10k token context document. Factor VIII hero positioning retained. Ecosystem table correct (BUILD→WORK→OPERATE).
- docs/README.md: Diataxis structure intact. Factor cross-reference table links to correct v3 filenames.

### Judge 2 (Consistency)

**Verdict:** WARN

- All modified files use v3 factor names consistently
- 4-tier structure (Foundation/Workflow/Knowledge/Scale) consistently applied
- v3 tagline consistent: "The Operational Discipline for Working With AI Agents"
- Minor: 3 aspirational links to non-existent guides (team-workflows, platform-engineering)
- Minor: Some unmodified explanation files (pattern-heritage, beads-workflow-integration, ecosystem-position, faafo-north-star) still contain old factor names — these were out of scope for this epic

### Judge 3 (Completeness)

**Verdict:** PASS

- 14 of 15 issues completed by agents (issues 1-14 content rewrite)
- Issue 15 (link verification + CHANGELOG) handled inline during recovery
- All conformance checks from plan pass
- SVG assets updated (carousel + landscape)
- Marketplace skills updated

## Shared Findings

1. Content quality is high — the agents produced coherent, well-structured rewrites
2. The v3 pivot is consistently applied across all modified files
3. Factor VIII "hero" positioning is maintained throughout

## Concerns Raised

1. **3 broken links (Low):** Aspirational next-step links to team-workflows.md and platform-engineering.md which don't exist yet. These are forward references, not regressions.
2. **Out-of-scope files (Info):** 4 explanation files not in this epic still have old factor names. Separate cleanup task.

## Recommendation

[x] SHIP - Content quality solid, v3 alignment consistent, no critical issues
[ ] FIX - 3 aspirational broken links could be removed (optional)
[ ] REFACTOR - N/A

## Decision

**WARN → SHIP.** The 3 broken links are aspirational forward references (low severity). The out-of-scope files are a separate concern. Core v3 rewrite is complete and consistent.
