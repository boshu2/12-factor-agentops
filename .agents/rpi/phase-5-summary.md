# Phase 5 Summary: Vibe (v3 docs rewrite)

**Epic:** 12-pr7 (v3 Documentation Full Rewrite)
**Report:** `.agents/council/20260215T182800Z-vibe-recent.md`
**Verdict:** WARN → SHIP

## Key Findings
- All conformance checks pass (no stale framing, no old factor names in scope)
- 3 aspirational broken links (low severity, forward refs to unwritten guides)
- 4 out-of-scope files still have old factor names (separate task)
- Content quality high, v3 alignment consistent across 41 files
