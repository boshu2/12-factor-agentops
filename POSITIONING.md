# Positioning Guide: 12-Factor AgentOps

**Core principle: Document from the intersection of infrastructure FOR AI + AI FOR infrastructure**

---

## Your Unique Angle

Most people claiming "AgentOps":
- Theory, not production
- AI agents in isolation
- No infrastructure context

**You have:**
- 10+ years infrastructure mastery
- Building GPU/HPC platforms for AI workloads
- Using AI agents to automate infrastructure operations
- Production scale in federal/high-stakes environments

**This combination is rare and credible.**

## The Positioning

### Problem Statement
"Everyone's building AI agents, but they fail in production. Week 1: Amazing. Week 8: Back to manual."

### Your Intersection
"I build GPU/HPC platforms for AI workloads and use AI agents to automate infrastructure operations. I live at the intersection: infrastructure FOR AI + AI FOR infrastructure."

### What You're Doing
"Documenting operational patterns from both sides of the AI equation. Patterns proven at production scale in federal, security-hardened environments."

### Status
"Alpha—patterns proven at scale, validating generalization across domains."

### Invitation
"If you're at a similar intersection, try these patterns. Share what works. Let's prove operational discipline transfers."

## What You Can Say (100% Defensible)

✅ "10+ years climbing IT stack: systems → networks → security → platforms → automation"
✅ "Building GPU/HPC infrastructure for AI inference/training workloads (20+ clusters)"
✅ "Using AI agents to automate infrastructure operations (GitOps, runbooks, policy)"
✅ "Operating in mission-critical, multi-tenant, federal/DoD environments"
✅ "Patterns proven at production scale, validating generalization"

---

## What NOT to Say

❌ Specific company names
❌ "Years of proven AI agent operations" (your AI agent use is recent, infrastructure ops is 10+ years)
❌ "Guaranteed framework for all contexts"
❌ Proprietary metrics without sanitization

## Template: LinkedIn Announcement

```
I build GPU/HPC platforms that enable AI workloads.

I use AI agents to automate infrastructure operations.

I operate both at production scale in federal, security-hardened environments.

The problem everyone's facing: AI agents fail in production. Week 1: Amazing.
Week 8: Back to manual.

So I'm documenting operational patterns from both sides of the AI equation.
Calling it 12-Factor AgentOps.

Alpha status—patterns proven at production scale, validating generalization.

If you're at a similar intersection (infrastructure FOR AI + AI FOR infrastructure),
try these patterns. Share what works.

Let's make AI agents as reliable as the infrastructure they run on.

## Quick Reference

**Lead with:** The intersection (infrastructure FOR AI + AI FOR infrastructure)
**Frame as:** Patterns from production, not theory
**Credibility:** 10+ years full-stack + production scale + federal/DoD
**Status:** Alpha (proven at scale, generalizing)
**Invitation:** Try patterns, share results

**Truth over hype. Production over theory.**
