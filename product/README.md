## Relationship to Other Documentation

This product planning documentation complements:
- [README.md](../README.md) - Public-facing framework overview
- [CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md) - AgentOps principles and contributing guide
- [ROADMAP.md](../ROADMAP.md) - Public roadmap summary (if exists)
- [EARLY_TESTER_GUIDE.md](../EARLY_TESTER_GUIDE.md) - Beta collaborator onboarding
- [LAUNCH_CHECKLIST.md](../LAUNCH_CHECKLIST.md) - Launch preparation tracker

This `product/` directory provides the internal strategic documentation that informs all public-facing materials.

## Maintenance

These documents should be reviewed and updated:
- After each phase transition (Alpha → Beta → v1.0)
- When strategic direction changes
- When success criteria are refined
- When major feedback warrants revision

All updates should maintain consistency across the three files and align with the framework's current positioning.
