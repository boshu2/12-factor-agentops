# Getting Started with 12-Factor AgentOps

Welcome! Choose your path based on what you want to achieve.

## Choose Your Journey

### 🚀 I want to start using AI workflows immediately

**Goal:** Get reliable results from AI agents as quickly as possible

**Start here:** [Quick Start Guide](quick-start.md)
- 15 minutes to first workflow
- See immediate 2-5x speedup
- Minimal setup required

---

### 👨‍💻 I'm a solo developer wanting better AI reliability

**Goal:** Go from 35% → 95% success rate with AI coding tools

**Start here:** [Solo Developer Guide](solo-developer.md)
- Focus on validation gates (Factor IV)
- Context management (Factor II)
- Pattern libraries (Factor XII)
- Real example: Database deployment 4 hours → 90 seconds

---

### 👥 I'm leading a team adopting AI workflows

**Goal:** Scale AI usage across a team without chaos

**Start here:** [Standing on Giants](../explanation/standing-on-giants.md) (team workflows coming soon)
- Shared pattern libraries
- Knowledge OS for institutional memory
- Human validation checkpoints (Factor VIII)
- Real example: 5-person team → 1-person productivity

---

### 🛠️ I'm a platform engineer building AI-powered automation

**Goal:** Production-grade AI systems with 99%+ reliability

**Start here:** [Platform Engineering Agent](../domain-guides/platform-engineering-agent.md)
- Full 12-factor implementation
- Measurement and observability (Factor V)
- Continuous improvement (Factors IX-XII)
- Real example: 55 applications, 0% context collapse

---

### 📚 I want to understand the philosophy first

**Goal:** Deep understanding before implementation

**Start here:** [The North Star](../explanation/faafo-north-star.md)
- Why this exists (the driving belief)
- How it connects to the 12 Factors
- Industry validation from AI Summit 2025

**Then:** [Standing on Giants](../explanation/standing-on-giants.md)
- How we adapted 12-Factor App
- DevOps/SRE patterns applied to AI
- Learning Science foundations

## Quick Comparison: Which Guide Is Right for You?

| Your Situation | Recommended Guide | Time to Value | Complexity |
|----------------|-------------------|---------------|------------|
| Just want to try it | Quick Start | 15 min | Low |
| Solo dev frustrated with AI failures | Solo Developer | 1-2 hours | Low |
| Team lead rolling out AI | Team Workflows | 1 day | Medium |
| Platform engineer | Platform Engineering | 1 week | High |
| Want philosophy first | North Star + Standing on Giants | 30 min reading | Low (reading) |

## What to Expect

### After 15 minutes (Quick Start)
✅ First AI workflow with validation gates
✅ 2-5x speedup on simple tasks
✅ Understanding of operational discipline philosophy

### After 1-2 hours (Solo Developer)
✅ 35% → 70% success rate improvement
✅ Context management preventing collapse
✅ Pattern library started

### After 1 day (Team Workflows)
✅ Shared knowledge OS
✅ Team using 4-6 factors consistently
✅ Institutional memory building

### After 1 week (Platform Engineering)
✅ All 12 factors implemented
✅ Production-grade reliability (95%+)
✅ Measurement and continuous improvement

## Common Questions

**Q: Do I need all 12 factors?**
A: No! Start with Factors I-IV (Foundation). Add more as you scale.

**Q: What if I'm not a developer?**
A: These principles work for all knowledge work. The examples use code, but patterns apply universally.

**Q: How long until I see results?**
A: Most people see 2-5x speedup within the first day. 95% success rate takes 1-2 weeks.

**Q: Is this only for AI agents?**
A: No! These patterns work for any knowledge work. AI just made them impossible to ignore.

**Q: Do I need special tools?**
A: No. Git + any AI assistant (Claude, GitHub Copilot, etc.) is enough. We show examples with specific tools, but principles are universal.

## Next Steps After Getting Started

1. **Read your chosen guide** (15 min - 1 week depending on path)
2. **Implement 1-2 factors** (start with Factor I + Factor IV)
3. **Measure results** (track success rate, speedup, quality)
4. **Add more factors incrementally** (based on pain points)
5. **Share patterns** (Factor XII: Package what works)
