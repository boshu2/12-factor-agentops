# Deep Dives & Extensions

**Core methodology:** [README.md](../README.md) → [Workflow Guide](tutorials/workflow-guide.md) → [factors/](../factors/)

**This directory contains** optional deep dives for those who want to understand the philosophy and research behind the framework.

---

## What's Here

### Principles (The Philosophy)
**Location:** `principles/`

The "why" behind the factors:
- **[Five Laws](principles/five-laws.md)** - Mandatory operational principles
- **[Four Pillars](principles/four-pillars.md)** - DevOps+SRE, Learning Science, Context Engineering, Knowledge OS
- **[Context Engineering](principles/context-engineering.md)** - The 40% rule and cognitive load management
- **[Knowledge OS](principles/knowledge-os.md)** - Git as institutional memory
- **[Evolution of 12-Factor](principles/evolution-of-12-factor.md)** - From cloud apps to AI agents

**Read if:** You want to understand the philosophical foundation

### Domain Guides (v2.0 - Coming Soon)
**Location:** `domain-guides/`

How to apply 12-Factor AgentOps in specific contexts:
- DevOps & Infrastructure
- Software Development
- Data Science & Analytics
- Solo Development

*Note: Domain guides are planned for v2.0 based on community implementations*

### Research (v2.0 - Coming Soon)
**Location:** `research/`

The research foundations and empirical validation.

*Note: Research validation and case studies are planned for v2.0*

### Advanced Patterns (v2.0 - Coming Soon)
**Location:** `advanced/`

Deep dives on complex patterns like multi-agent orchestration.

*Note: Advanced patterns are planned for v2.0 based on production usage*

### Case Studies (v2.0 - Coming Soon)
**Location:** `case-studies/`

Real production examples and metrics.

*Note: Case studies will be collected from community implementations for v2.0*

## How to Navigate

**Start simple (1.0.0 core):**
1. Read [README.md](../README.md) - Understand what this is (10 min)
2. Read [Workflow Guide](tutorials/workflow-guide.md) - Learn the workflow (20 min)
3. Read [factors/](../factors/) - Deep dive on any factor (15 min each)

**Go deeper (optional):**
4. Browse `principles/` - Understand the philosophy (1+ hours)
5. Contribute - Share your implementation and learnings

**For different goals:**
- **"I want the methodology"** → Start with README + WORKFLOW
- **"I want the philosophy"** → Read `principles/`
- **"I want to contribute"** → Implement, measure, share results

---

## Contributing

**For 1.0.0, we're seeking:**
- Real implementations using the workflow
- Before/after metrics (reliability, velocity)
- Patterns discovered through usage
- Improvements to the core methodology

**For v2.0, we'll add:**
- Domain-specific guides
- Advanced patterns
- Case studies
- Research validation

**See:** [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) for process

**Remember:** The core methodology is simple—12 factors and a workflow. This directory provides optional depth on the philosophy behind them.

Start with README + WORKFLOW. Come here when you want to understand why it works.
