## What's Here

### Principles (The Philosophy)
**Location:** `marketplace/principles/`

The "why" behind the factors:
- **Four Pillars** - DevOps+SRE, Learning Science, Context Engineering, Knowledge OS
- **Five Laws** - Mandatory operational principles
- **Context Engineering** - The 40% rule and cognitive load management
- **Knowledge OS** - Git as institutional memory

**Read if:** You want to understand the philosophical foundation

### Domain Guides (Practical Applications)
**Location:** `marketplace/domain-guides/`

How to apply 12-Factor AgentOps in specific contexts:
- DevOps & Infrastructure

## How to Navigate

**Start simple:**
1. Read [README.md](../README.md) - Understand what this is (10 min)
2. Read [FACTORS.md](../FACTORS.md) - Learn the 12 factors (30 min)
3. Read [WORKFLOW.md](../WORKFLOW.md) - Apply the methodology (20 min)

**Go deeper:**
4. Browse `marketplace/` - Pick what interests you (hours available)
5. Contribute - Share your patterns and validation

**For different goals:**
- **"I want the theory"** → `principles/`
- **"I want practical guidance"** → `domain-guides/`
- **"I want proof"** → `research/` and `case-studies/`
- **"I want to master this"** → `advanced/`
