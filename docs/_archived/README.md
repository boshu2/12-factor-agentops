# Archived Content

**Archived:** 2026-01-31
**Reason:** Scope narrowed from "reliable AI agents" to "coding agents"

These files document operational patterns for general production agents.

## Why Archived

12-Factor AgentOps is now focused specifically on **coding agents** - AI assistants that write, modify, or review code (like Claude Code). The archived content covers:

- Infrastructure automation agents
- Platform engineering workflows
- Production orchestration patterns

These use cases are better served by:
- [12-Factor Agents](https://github.com/humanlayer/12-factor-agents) - General autonomous agent patterns
- [Olympus Architecture](https://github.com/boshu2/olympus) - Production agent orchestration
