## Go/No-Go Decision Matrix

### ✅ PASS = Green Light to Dual Launch
**All sections must be at least 80% complete** (higher bar for coordinated launch)

### 🔴 FAIL = Hold & Fix
Any section below 80% blocks launch. Reschedule to Dec 8.

### ⚠️ WATCH = Monitor Closely

## Go/No-Go Decision Criteria (Dec 1)

### 🟢 GO (Launch Monday Dec 1)
- **All four categories at or above thresholds**
- Content Integrity: 100% (non-negotiable for dual launch)
- Repository Readiness: 100% (both repos public-ready)
- Community Readiness: 80%+ (3-5 beta collaborators confirmed)
- Personal Readiness: 100% (committed to campaign)
- **Decision:** Proceed with dual launch

### 🔴 NO-GO (Delay to Dec 8)
- **Any critical category below threshold**
- Content Integrity below 100%: Content still incomplete
- Repository Readiness below 100%: Repos not ready for public
- Community Readiness below 80%: Not enough beta commitments
- Personal Readiness below 100%: Not ready to execute
- **Decision:** Reschedule for Dec 8 (one week delay acceptable)

### ⚠️ LAUNCH WITH CAUTION
- All categories at or above minimum
- But some at edge of threshold (90-100%)
- Plan for rapid iterations based on feedback
- Be ready to pause if critical issues emerge

---

## Decision Authority & Escalation

**Who decides:** You (Boden)

**When:** Monday Nov 25 EOD (before Tuesday launch)

**Escalation if blocked:**
1. Identify which category is blocking
2. Assess if it can be resolved in 48 hours
3. If yes: Delay to Dec 2 soft launch
4. If no: Move to Dec 9 with extended prep

---

## Post-Launch Success Criteria

If you launch, you succeed when:

### Within 1 week (by Dec 2)
- ✅ Post 1 published without major issues
- ✅ 3-5 early testers identified
- ✅ 0 critical content errors found

### Within 2 weeks (by Dec 9)
- ✅ 10+ people aware of framework
- ✅ 2-3 early testers actively reviewing
- ✅ Initial feedback collected

### Within 4 weeks (by Dec 23)
- ✅ 100+ people across network aware
- ✅ 5 committed early testers engaged
- ✅ First round of learning documented

---

## Critical Success Factors

### ✅ Content Must Be Honest
- Problem-first framing (agents fail in production)
- Hypothesis clearly stated (can DevOps help?)
- Explorer positioning (I'm testing)
- Invitation to co-create (help validate)
- Zero false claims (no "proven," "production-ready," metrics)

### ✅ Positioning Must Be Consistent
- All 10 posts follow POSITIONING.md
- All 4 case studies show experiments (not proofs)
- All 5 articles say "Status: Experimental"
- All 53 playbook templates use "I'm testing"

### ✅ Personal Commitment Must Be Real
- You can respond to feedback
- You can post 1-2x per week
- You can learn from criticism
- You're comfortable with uncertainty

---

## Rollback Plan

If you launch and issues emerge:

**Option 1: Pause (no shame)**
- Archive Post 1 as "draft"
- Apologize briefly: "Cleaning up positioning"
- Take 1-2 weeks to fix
- Relaunch when ready

**Option 2: Pivot (adjust course)**
- Continue posting
- Adjust tone based on feedback
- Document learnings transparently
- Show community you're listening

**Option 3: Continue (full steam)**
- Accept imperfections
- Fix incrementally
- Move fast, learn from users
- Embrace "ship -> learn -> improve"
