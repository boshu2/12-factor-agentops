# 12-Factor AgentOps

## Purpose

The 12-Factor methodology adapted for AI agent development. This is a documentation and methodology repository.

## Content Focus

This repo defines the 12 factors for building reliable AI agents:

1. **Codebase** - One codebase, many deploys
2. **Dependencies** - Explicitly declare and isolate
3. **Config** - Store config in environment
4. **Backing Services** - Treat as attached resources
5. **Build, Release, Run** - Strictly separate stages
6. **Processes** - Execute as stateless processes
7. **Port Binding** - Export services via port binding
8. **Concurrency** - Scale out via process model
9. **Disposability** - Fast startup, graceful shutdown
10. **Dev/Prod Parity** - Keep environments similar
11. **Logs** - Treat as event streams
12. **Admin Processes** - Run as one-off processes

## Documentation Standards

### Markdown Structure
```markdown
# Factor N: Name

## The Factor

Brief description of the principle.

## Why It Matters for AI Agents

Agent-specific rationale.

## Implementation

Concrete guidance.

## Examples

Code examples and patterns.

## Anti-patterns

What to avoid.
```

### Diagrams
Use Mermaid for diagrams:
```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Agent] --> B[Tool]
    B --> C[Result]
```

## Writing Style

- Clear, concise explanations
- Practical examples over theory
- Show anti-patterns alongside patterns
- Reference real-world agent scenarios

## Don't

- Don't be overly academic
- Don't skip practical examples
- Don't forget agent-specific context
- Don't use jargon without explanation
